# Define a method, #hipsterfy, that accepts a sentence (string) as an argument.
# The method should return a new string with the last vowel removed from each word.

# 'y' is not a vowel. If a word has no vowels, don't change it. You may assume all
# letters are lower-case.

# hipsterfy("towel flicker banana") => "towl flickr banan"
